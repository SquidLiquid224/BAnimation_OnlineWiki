#### Installing Autodesk products at home is easy due to Autodesk's free education licenses.  This software is taught in second year, so you may want to skip this topic is you are a First-Year student. To start, go to Autodesk’s Free software website:  
#### [www.autodesk.com/education/free-software](https://www.autodesk.com/education/free-software) 
<br>
#### **Downloading** 
<br>
Once there, scroll down to the free educational license products list and find the software that you wish to download and install on your home computer.
<br>
Next you will have to create an Autodesk Account. Underneath the product description select the second option **Get Started** 
On the Get education benefits webpage use the drop-down option to complete your details and select the **“NEXT”** button.   
<br>
On the Create account page fill in your personal details.  Make sure to use your **Sheridan E-mail address** on this page.  Once you have entered your details you will need to verify your Autodesk account through Sheridan's logon on page.  When you have completed your verification, you will be redirected back to the Autodesk Free Software website. Now you will be able to claim your license key and download your software.  
<br>
Back on the Autodesk free software page fill in the following details of the software:  
<br>
    **Version**   
    Maya 2020  
    Mudbox 2020  
    <br>
    **Operating system**  
    Window or Mac  
    <br>
    **Choose the language of the software.**   
    For tech support reasons please choose English  
<br>
Once you have filled out your software details you will be sent a confirmation E-mail by Autodesk.      
<br>
Now you can download and install your Software.  By default, the **“INSTALL NOW”** button will be active, if you press it a web installer will automate your installation.     
<br>
**NOTE: This method can be unstable at times.  I recommend selecting the arrow to the right of the “INSTALL NOW” button and select “DOWNLOAD NOW”.**  

<br>
The **“Download Now”** will allow you to download the software and install the software manually.   
**NOTE:You may need to enable your browser to download multiple files. The software is rather large and is broken into several parts. I found Mozzilla Firefox works best for this.** 
<br>
When the Autodesk software has finished downloading, initialize the installer by running the first downloaded part.    
<br>
#### **Installing**   
<br>
When the download is complete select the **“Install”** button.   
<br>
When the installation window appears select the **“Agree”** button and the **“Next”** button and finally the **“Install”** button.    
<br>
When the **“Data collection and use”** window pops-up I recommend **unchecking** the Agreement and pressing **“OK”**    
<br>
When the installation is complete select the **“Start”** button   
<br>
#### **Activating**    
<br>
Now you will need to activate your software.  
On the **"Let’s Get Started window"**  
<br>
Select the **“I Agree”** button on the Autodesk Privacy Statement.    
<br>
Then on the Product License Activation page select the **“Activate”** button.   
<br>
Finally, Enter your Autodesk Username and Password to activate the software.
