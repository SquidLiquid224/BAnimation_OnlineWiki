#### **The required software and hardware for this couse are.**

* Stop Motion Studio software (available for Mac or PC)

* a webcam that is compatible with the software (For more info on this see the [Computer Peripherals](https://squidliquid224.github.io/BAnimation_OnlineWiki/articles/Week05) section)

* basic tripod that is compatible with the webcam (For more info on this see the [Computer Peripherals](https://squidliquid224.github.io/BAnimation_OnlineWiki/articles/Week05) section)

* clay/plastercine. Any brand any colour, approx. 1 pound. The dollar store is a great place to find inexpensive plastercine.

NOTE: other common materials will also be used and this list will be provided in Week 1.


#### To simplify:

* Use a mobile (phone or tablet) version of Stop Motion Studio.

* Use a tripod or stand that connects to your mobile device.\n\n
