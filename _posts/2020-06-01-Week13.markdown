title: Tech Requirements for fall 3rd year stop motion course (ANIM 17721)  
date: June 19, 2020
---

Required:

-Stop Motion Studio software (available for Mac or PC)

-a webcam that is compatible with the software (software’s tech support should be able to confirm, if needed, although most common webcams should work)

-basic tripod that is compatible with the webcam

-clay/plastercine. Any brand any colour, approx. 1 pound.

-other common materials will also be used, and this list will be provided in Week 1.

 

Webcam suggestions:

Ideally ,you will want a high definition webcam that has a manual focus. This is very important because an autofocus camera will constantly adjust to give you the best live conditions which are constantly changing. In stopmotion you need to maintain your lighting and focus until you are finished your shot. 

With linear shooting this will cause both focal and lighting changes all through your shots.

So remember to think Manual. 

There are several models out there specifically for Macs and many more for P.C.

I found one online that works for both according to the specs  but have not had the chance to test it myself.

Dragonframe if you have it already but not required for the course.

Dragonframe should not cost more than 180$ canadian if you are a student.


If the required tech is not available to a student, the student can simplify further and achieve the course’s learning outcomes, but their educational experience will not be as robust.

 

To simplify:

Use a mobile (for phone or tablet) version of Stop Motion Studio.

Use a tripod or stand that connects to your mobile device.

 

Note: If a student has more advanced tech (for example, Dragonframe software, a DSLR camera that works with Dragonframe, a power adaptor to plug the DSLR into the wall), a student can also use this in the course, but it is not required.
