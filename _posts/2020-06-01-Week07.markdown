Once your home workstation is setup and before you begin to install your software is it a good idea to do all updates for your operating system.  Installing the updates will ensure that your system drivers and security feature are up to date.  Always make a backup of your work files before doing any large updates. 

 Updating your Windows 10 operating system  

    Select the Windows button from the bottom-left corner. 

    Select the gear icon to access the settings 

    Scroll to the bottom and select Update and Security. 

    Select the first option Windows Update tab in the sidebar (Circular arrows) 

    Select Check for updates. If there is an available update, it will begin downloading automatically. 

Updating your iOS (Mac) operating system 

    Choose System Preferences from the Apple menu, then click Software Update.  

    If any updates are available, click the Update button to install them.
