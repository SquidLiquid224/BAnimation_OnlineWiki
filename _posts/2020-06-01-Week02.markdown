When preparing for online classes you should consider three main aspects of your home workstation.  
<br>
* #### Is your computer fast enough to run the required software?  
* #### Do you have a tablet that will work properly for animation?  
* #### Lastly, is your internet connection fast enough to properly work remotely?   
<br>

### **2. Do you have a tablet that will work properly for animation?**  
<br>
The second thing you should prepare for your online classes is a digital drawing tablet.  Sheridan has reduced your tuition to help you purchase your own tablet, the **Wacom One** is recommended and avaiable at a reduced price. Detailed instructions on purchaseing, setup and installing the drivers are covered on this page.  
**NOTE: If you already own a tablet you are welcome to use that model, the Wacom One is just the basic model that is recommended.**

### **3. Lastly, is your internet connection fast enough to properly work remotely?**  
<br>
You will also need a fast internet connection for online meetings and possibly the remote operation of a Sheridan Workstation.  High-speed internet is generally about 50mbs download and 10mbs upload speed.  This is the ideal speed for online working, although; you may be able to work with speeds of 12mbs Download and 4mbs upload. To check your internet connection speed, go to fast.com and from there make upgrades to your internet service as needed. Below is a link to a detailed document on internet speeds and services.
